## A Robotic Arm for Cube Detection and Manipulation

Yi Chen, Da Li, and Zhen Wu


Abstract - This report presents a six degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic arm (Rex-arm) with integrated acting, sensing and reasoning functionalities to autonomously grasp, align and stack cubes. A 2 DOF gripper is designed and fabricated by 3-D printing to perform grasping and releasing the cubes. Secondly, a Kinetic sensor (a RGB camera and a depth sensor) is calibrated and used to detect and localize the cubes. The accuracy of the sensing system is demonstrated to be 2.3 mm in RMSE. A motion planning algorithm incorporating solving inverse kinematic and generating intermediate way points is developed to perform pick and place of cubes. Last, a finite state machine is implemented to integrate each module to perform events specified user.
